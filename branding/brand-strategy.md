*   A sophisticated and minimalist logo that combines a stylized 'A' with a subtle soundwave or a speech mark. The design should be clean, balanced, and easily recognizable. It should work well in a single color and across various digital and print applications.

### Color Palette
*   **Primary Colors:**
    *   **Deep Navy (#0A192F):** Represents trust, authority, and intelligence.
    *   **Charcoal Gray (#333333):** A professional and sophisticated neutral.
    *   **Clean White (#FFFFFF):** For a clean, modern, and premium feel.
*   **Accent Color:**
    *   **Polished Gold (#D4AF37):** To be used sparingly to reinforce the premium positioning and highlight key elements.

### Typography
*   **Primary Typeface (Headings):** A modern, elegant serif font like **Lora** or **Playfair Display**. This will convey a sense of authority and sophistication.
*   **Secondary Typeface (Body Text):** A clean, readable sans-serif font like **Lato** or **Open Sans**. This will ensure clarity and accessibility for longer-form content.
