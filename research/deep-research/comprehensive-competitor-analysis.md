### User Feedback

**Reddit - Positive Review (r/AIToolTesting, 1 month ago):**

User tested Retell AI for small business phone calls and reported:

**Pros:**
- "The voices are super natural. Customers didn't instantly know they were talking to an AI."
- "It actually handles interruptions well—if someone cuts it off mid-sentence, it doesn't break."
- "Outbound calling works smoothly"
- "Calendar system integration for automatic booking"
- "Call analytics + compliance built in gave me peace of mind"

**Cons:**
- "Definitely more developer-oriented"
- "Had to get some light tech help to set things up"
- "Not as drag-and-drop as other no-code tools"

**Conclusion:** "For a small business trying to save time on repetitive calls, Retell has been really solid. I could see this replacing at least a couple of part-time callers for us."

**Comparative Reddit Thread (r/AI_Agents, 1 month ago):**

User tested Bland, Synthflow, and Retell across 200 outbound calls:

**Results:**
- Bland AI: "Almost no traction, people hung up"
- Synthflow: "~9% conversion"
- **Retell AI: "~17% conversion, people stayed on longer"**

**Key Quote:** "Retell AI... the difference was in how it handled interruptions and off-script stuff. Customers cut in, asked clarifications, even changed direction mid-call, and it actually responded instead of breaking. Voices felt more natural too — less of that awkward lag."

**r/AI_Agents General Sentiment:**
- "Synthflow works better for quick prototypes or if you don't want to code much. **Retell AI feels more enterprise ready with compliance and better handling of edge cases.**"

- **Lowest per-minute pricing** ($0.07/min)
- Excellent interruption handling
- Natural voice quality
- Developer-friendly API
- No setup fees or monthly minimums
