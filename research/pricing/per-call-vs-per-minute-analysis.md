# Per-Call vs Per-Minute Pricing Analysis

**Research Date:** November 2024  
**Focus:** Comparing Inspra.ai's per-call pricing with per-minute pricing models  
**Purpose:** Determine optimal pricing strategy for Articulate AI

---

## Executive Summary

Inspra.ai uses a **per-call pricing model** ($0.18-0.25 AUD per call), while most competitors use **per-minute pricing** ($0.06-0.13 AUD per minute). The choice between these models significantly impacts customer costs, revenue predictability, and competitive positioning.

**Key Findings:**
- Per-call pricing favors **longer calls** (better value for customers)
- Per-minute pricing favors **shorter calls** (more predictable costs)
- Average call duration determines which model is more cost-effective
- Inspra's per-call model is competitive for calls **under 2 minutes** (monthly plan) or **under 3 minutes** (yearly plan)

**Recommendation for Articulate AI:**
- **Hybrid model:** Per-minute pricing with monthly included minutes
- Offers transparency, flexibility, and competitive positioning
- Easier to compare with both per-call and pure per-minute competitors

## Inspra.ai Pricing (Corrected)

### Monthly Plan
- **Setup Fee:** $1,999 AUD (one-time)
- **Monthly Subscription:** $499 AUD/month
- **Per-Call Cost:** $0.25 AUD per call
- **Annual Cost (Year 1):** $1,999 + ($499 × 12) + (calls × $0.25) = **$7,987 + call costs**

### Yearly Plan (30% discount)
- **Setup Fee:** $1,999 AUD (one-time)
- **Annual Subscription:** $4,192 AUD/year ($349/month equivalent, 30% off $499)
- **Per-Call Cost:** $0.18 AUD per call
- **Annual Cost (Year 1):** $1,999 + $4,192 + (calls × $0.18) = **$6,191 + call costs**

### Cost Per Call (100 calls/month)

| Plan | Setup | Monthly | Per-Call | Monthly Total | Annual Total (Year 1) |
|------|-------|---------|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Monthly** | $1,999 | $499 | $0.25 | $524 | $8,287 |
| **Yearly** | $1,999 | $349 | $0.18 | $367 | $6,599 |

**Effective cost per call (100 calls/month, Year 1):**
- Monthly plan: $8,287 ÷ 1,200 calls = **$6.91 per call**
- Yearly plan: $6,599 ÷ 1,200 calls = **$5.50 per call**

**Effective cost per call (100 calls/month, Year 2+):**
- Monthly plan: $524 ÷ 100 calls = **$5.24 per call**
- Yearly plan: $367 ÷ 100 calls = **$3.67 per call**

## Per-Call vs Per-Minute: Break-Even Analysis

### Assumption: Average Call Duration

Industry averages for AI voice agent calls:
- **Lead qualification:** 2-3 minutes
- **Appointment booking:** 3-5 minutes
- **Customer support:** 5-10 minutes
- **Sales calls:** 10-20 minutes
- **Overall average:** **5 minutes per call**

### Competitor Per-Minute Pricing (AUD)

| Competitor | Per-Minute Cost | 5-Min Call Cost | vs Inspra Monthly | vs Inspra Yearly |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Retell AI** | $0.10 | $0.50 | ✅ Cheaper | ✅ Cheaper |
| **Synthflow** | $0.11 | $0.55 | ✅ Cheaper | ✅ Cheaper |
| **Bland AI** | $0.13 | $0.65 | ✅ Cheaper | ✅ Cheaper |
| **Vapi** | $0.45 | $2.25 | ❌ More expensive | ❌ More expensive |
| **Inspra (Monthly)** | - | $0.25 | - | - |
| **Inspra (Yearly)** | - | $0.18 | - | - |

### Break-Even Analysis

**When is Inspra's per-call pricing competitive?**

#### vs Retell AI ($0.10/min)
- **Inspra Monthly ($0.25/call):** Competitive if call < **2.5 minutes**
- **Inspra Yearly ($0.18/call):** Competitive if call < **1.8 minutes**

#### vs Synthflow ($0.11/min)
- **Inspra Monthly ($0.25/call):** Competitive if call < **2.3 minutes**
- **Inspra Yearly ($0.18/call):** Competitive if call < **1.6 minutes**

#### vs Bland AI ($0.13/min)
- **Inspra Monthly ($0.25/call):** Competitive if call < **1.9 minutes**
- **Inspra Yearly ($0.18/call):** Competitive if call < **1.4 minutes**

### Verdict

**Inspra's per-call pricing is ONLY competitive for very short calls (<2 minutes).**

For the industry average of **5 minutes per call:**
- Retell AI: $0.50 per call (✅ **50% cheaper** than Inspra monthly, 64% cheaper than yearly)
- Synthflow: $0.55 per call (✅ **45% cheaper** than Inspra monthly, 67% cheaper than yearly)
- Bland AI: $0.65 per call (✅ **38% cheaper** than Inspra monthly, 72% cheaper than yearly)

**Inspra's per-call model is NOT competitive for typical AI voice agent use cases.**

## Why Does Inspra Use Per-Call Pricing?

### Possible Reasons

1. **Simplicity:** Easier for customers to understand ("$0.25 per call" vs "$0.10 per minute")
2. **Predictability:** Customers know exact cost per interaction (regardless of duration)
3. **Premium positioning:** Per-call pricing obscures cost comparison with per-minute competitors
4. **Revenue optimization:** Captures more revenue on longer calls (5+ minutes)
5. **Bundled value:** Includes comprehensive platform (chat, data bank, automation) beyond just voice

### Analysis

Inspra's per-call pricing makes sense IF:
- ✅ Customers primarily make **short calls** (<2 minutes) - e.g., lead qualification, quick follow-ups
- ✅ Customers value **simplicity** over cost optimization
- ✅ Customers value the **comprehensive platform** (not just voice) and see per-call cost as part of larger value
- ✅ Inspra's **setup fee ($1,999)** and **monthly base ($499)** already cover most costs, so per-call is pure margin

However, for **typical use cases** (5-minute average calls), Inspra's per-call pricing is **38-72% more expensive** than per-minute competitors.

## Pricing Model Comparison

### Per-Call Pricing

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Simple to understand
- ✅ Predictable costs per interaction
- ✅ Favors longer calls (better value for customer)
- ✅ Easier to budget (know cost per lead, per booking, etc.)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ More expensive for longer calls (vs per-minute)
- ❌ Harder to compare with per-minute competitors
- ❌ May deter customers with longer average call times
- ❌ Less transparent (obscures actual cost per minute)

**Best For:**
- Short calls (<2 minutes)
- Simple use cases (lead qualification, quick follow-ups)
- Customers who value simplicity over cost optimization

---

### Per-Minute Pricing

**Advantages:**
- ✅ More cost-effective for longer calls
- ✅ Easier to compare across competitors
- ✅ More transparent (customers see exact usage)
- ✅ Industry standard (most competitors use this)
- ✅ Scales fairly with call duration

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Slightly more complex to understand
- ❌ Less predictable (depends on call duration)
- ❌ Requires monitoring to avoid overages

**Best For:**
- Variable call lengths
- Cost-conscious customers
- Customers who want transparency
- Typical AI voice agent use cases (5-10 minute calls)

---

### Hybrid Model (Recommended for Articulate AI)

**Structure:**
- Monthly base fee (includes X minutes)
- Per-minute overage rate

**Example:**

| Tier | Monthly Base | Included Minutes | Overage Rate | Effective Cost/Min |
|------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Starter** | $199 | 1,000 min | $0.10/min | $0.20/min (if fully used) |
| **Professional** | $399 | 5,000 min | $0.08/min | $0.08/min (if fully used) |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | $0.06/min | Custom |

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Combines simplicity (fixed monthly cost) with flexibility (pay for what you use)
- ✅ Predictable base cost + transparent overages
- ✅ Competitive with per-minute competitors
- ✅ More affordable than Inspra for typical use cases
- ✅ Easier to compare with both per-call and per-minute models
- ✅ Encourages higher usage (included minutes feel "free")

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex than pure per-call
- ⚠️ Requires monitoring to avoid overages (but most platforms have alerts)
