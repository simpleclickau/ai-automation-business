### User Responses

#### NEGATIVE Feedback (Majority)

**User: Impressive-Move-5722** (3mo ago)
> "I'd hate to deal with an AI assistant in order to speak with an Agent or PM."

**Sentiment:** Strong rejection of AI for human interaction

**User: OldCrankyCarnt** (3mo ago)
> "Lead qualification to get a listing? Like will anyone right in their mind list their property with an agent who treats them to AI?  
> I guess buyers will have to put up with that shit, and renters have no rights whatsoever.  
> But why not get rid of an RE agent altogether? Now this is an idea a lot will get behind"

**Sentiment:** Very negative, sees AI as disrespectful to sellers, suggests eliminating agents entirely

**User Response** (3mo ago)
> "God yes, there's already self-hosted property sales in the US where you can more or less do all the steps an agent does but without the tens of thousands in fees. But with our obsession with auctions and this primitive dance we all seem to love doing instead of developing a proper 21st century marketplace means it's virtually useless.  
> But I dream we might finally be rid of those clowns with the hammers in everyone's back yards on the weekend."

**Sentiment:** Negative toward agents, sees AI as potential replacement not assistant

**User Response** (3mo ago) - MOST DETAILED NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
> "Not sure if you're in the right neck of the woods, we're the ones who are usually getting shafted by RE agents. But here's my 2 cents as homeowner.  
>   
> If I were to hear any AI fuckery when I try to contact an agent, that's enough to not want to deal with that agency again or take part in their properties as a buyer or seller.  
>   
> If every other agency in the area has the decency to speak to me like a human being, even if I am unqualified or just marginally interested, why on God's green earth would I ever perceive an agency using AI voice bots to be better?  
>   
> Make it answer emails, texts, whatever that doesn't require real social interactions and you can just give me the details in one go.  
>   
> But phone calls? I already read enough AI slop online and if I have to stand there with my phone to my ear talking to AI-Linda about my potential interest in what is perhaps the most high ticket item anyone would ever buy in their lives, I'd rather stuff my anus full of hot chips and lie ass up at the fish market."

**Key Points:**
- Would refuse to deal with agencies using AI voice
- Perceives AI as lack of decency/respect
- OK with AI for emails/texts, NOT for phone calls
- High-ticket purchases (property) require human interaction
- Extremely strong emotional rejection

**Sentiment:** Extremely negative, colorful language shows depth of feeling

#### POSITIVE Feedback (Minority)

**User Response** (2mo ago)
> "I've been dabbling with AI voice agents in my real estate flow recently, mostly through a platform that is a no-code voice stack that lets you build agents tailored for specific niches like real estate.  
>   
> At first, I was hesitant to let an AI handle first contact, but once I structured the flows properly, it actually started working better than expected. It filters out the noise so I only focus on the serious leads.  
>   
> I didn't need to code anything, just prompt-engineered the responses and set up the automations."

**Platform Used:** Awaz AI (mentioned in follow-up)

**Key Points:**
- Initially hesitant
- Works better than expected after proper setup
- Filters unqualified leads effectively
- No-code platform
- Prompt engineering important

**Sentiment:** Positive, practical experience

**Platform Used:** VoiceGenie

**Use Cases:** Visit reminders and follow-ups (NOT first contact)

**Sentiment:** Positive for specific use cases

## Key Insights

### Consumer Sentiment (Negative)

2. **Perception of disrespect** - Using AI seen as "not having decency" to speak to customers
3. **Differentiation factor** - Agencies NOT using AI seen as better
4. **High-ticket items require humans** - Property purchases too important for AI
5. **AI acceptable for async** - Emails/texts OK, phone calls NOT OK

### Agent/Business Sentiment (Mixed to Positive)
1. **Lead filtering works** - AI effective at qualifying leads
2. **Time savings** - Reduces time on unqualified calls
3. **Use case matters** - Reminders/follow-ups acceptable, first contact risky
4. **Setup is critical** - Proper flow design essential for success
5. **No-code platforms preferred** - Awaz AI, VoiceGenie mentioned

### Platforms Mentioned
1. **Intervo AI** - Being promoted (mixed reception)
2. **Awaz AI** - Positive user experience (no-code, real estate niche)
3. **VoiceGenie** - Positive for reminders/follow-ups

## Strategic Implications for Articulate AI

### DO:
- Position for **after-hours** and **overflow** calls (not replacement)
- Emphasize **lead qualification** and **filtering** (saves agent time)
- Focus on **reminders, follow-ups, scheduling** (less sensitive)
- Offer **human escalation** prominently
- Target **agents/businesses** not end consumers
- Emphasize **time savings** and **never missing leads**

### DON'T:
- Position as replacement for human agents
- Use for first contact with high-value customers (property sellers)
- Market to consumers (they don't want it)
- Ignore the emotional resistance to AI voice
- Underestimate importance of voice quality and naturalness

### Positioning:
**"Your AI assistant handles the routine so your team can focus on the relationships that matter"**

NOT: "Replace your team with AI"

### Target Use Cases:
1. ✅ After-hours coverage
2. ✅ Overflow during busy periods
3. ✅ Lead qualification (initial screening)
4. ✅ Appointment reminders
5. ✅ Follow-ups
6. ✅ FAQ handling
7. ❌ First contact with high-value prospects
8. ❌ Replacing human agents entirely
